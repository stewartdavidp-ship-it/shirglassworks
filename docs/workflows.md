## Events

### Set Up and Run a Craft Fair Event
**Status:** Live

How to create an event in the system, allocate the inventory you're bringing, and track sales during the show.

5. At the fair, open the POS app — the recommended way is to click "Open PoS" on the active event in the admin app, which pre-links the event automatically
6. If you open the POS without a pre-linked event, it detects your location and shows a confirmation dialog with the active event(s) — confirm the right one, pick a different event, or dismiss
7. Use the ⚙ button in the top bar at any time to switch events, unlink, or link to a different active event
8. Ring up sales as normal — sold quantities are tracked against your allocation
9. The event banner shows: packed / sold / remaining at a glance

1. After the event, open the admin app and go to Sell → Events
2. Open the event and review the sold vs. packed summary
3. For any sales taken offline or outside the POS: click + Manual Sale, pick the product from your event allocations, enter the quantity, amount, and payment type, then save
4. The manual sale is recorded, the event allocation sold count is updated, and inventory is decremented automatically
5. When reconciliation is complete, click Close Event
6. Unsold pieces are returned to available stock
